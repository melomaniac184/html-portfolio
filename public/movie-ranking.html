<h1>The Best Movies according to Shreya!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Shyam Singha Roy</h3>
<p>It's a Sai Pallavi movie. She's my Favourite!!! Story of this movie is also based on interesting topic "reincarnation"</p>
<h3>Hey Sinamika</h3>
<p>I dont like this movie becuase of it's story or characters. I like this because, I found my purpose of life after watching this movie. (It had nothing to do with the movie actually) But I don't think I would have figured my career out at that time, if this movie wasn't there!</p>
<h3>Behind her eyes</h3>
<p>Now I know this is not a movie, it's a series. But I really liked it. Like there's suspence in this series up to last 6 minutes of last episode!! Hats off to the writer.</p>
